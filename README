repomon is a simple script designed to monitor various remote repositories and
notify you when there are updates.  It supports git, subversion, mercurial,
maybe more in the future.

It reads ~/.repomon.rc (can be overridden on the command line with -c), which
lists one repository per line in the following format (delimited by
whitespace):

identifier	protocol	url	[-bt] arguments...

	identifier:	any unique identifier
	protocol:	git, hg, or svn
	url:		url of repository
	arguments:	branch name (where relevant) or
			-b branch glob pattern
			-t tag glob pattern

Blank lines and those beginning with # are ignored.

When repomon is run, it prints (on stdout) any new activity in the repositories
specified.  For example, you may want a cron job like this:

0 6 * * * repomon

For now the output is very minimal (basically just revision numbers), and
there's no output if nothing has changed.  The (human-readable) state is stored
in ~/.repomon.state (override with -s).

Examples:

# watch for any new commits to subversion itself (branch is just appended to url):
subversion svn http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion trunk
# watch for any new commits to the linux 2.6 stable branch:
linux-stable git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6-stable.git stable
# watch for any new branch in the linux 2.6 stable repo:
linux-rel git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6-stable.git -b
# watch for new firefox release tags in the mozilla repository:
firefox-central hg http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central -t FIREFOX_*_RELEASE
